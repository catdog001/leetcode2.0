1.要求：We have some permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N - 1], where N is the length of A.
    The number of (global) inversions is the number of i < j with 0 <= i < j < N and A[i] > A[j].
    The number of local inversions is the number of i with 0 <= i < N and A[i] > A[i+1].
    Return true if and only if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.
    Input: A = [1,0,2] Output: true Explanation: There is 1 global inversion, and 1 local inversion.
    Input: A = [1,2,0] Output: false Explanation: There are 2 global inversions, and 1 local inversion.
    A will be a permutation of [0, 1, ..., A.length - 1]. 
    A will have length in range [1, 5000]. 
    The time limit for this problem has been reduced.
